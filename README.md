# Florence_IROS_2021_MMH

## Problem Statement
In the light of the present pandemic, it has become a key necessity to control the spread and decrease the impact of the virus in the greatest manner possible. We present an intelligent nurse, FLORENCE, who, in a containment facility, detects the face of each patient and administers the patient’s unique set of medicines from a separate trolley based on a predetermined database. She further checks the patient’s temperature and updates the information in the database. This prevents the need for a human nurse to approach the patient and hence reduces the risk of spreading the disease. On detection or by request, FLORENCE sprays sanitizer on the hands of patients and visitors. For the purpose of serving the patient, she also uses a hybrid of the original hand and a specially designed hand with three fingers. We intend to perform the simulations on the WeBots platform prior to the implementation of FLORENCE on the TIAGo++ robot by PAL Robotics.
